## Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason
to change. Responsibility is a family of functions that serves one particular actor.
"Actor for a responsibility is the single source of change for that responsibility" - Robert C. Martin.

The classes that adhere to SRP tend to have <b>high cohesion</b>.
